This course is designed for students who wish to master Python as a programming language and build data analysis solutions with Python along with several widely used libraries. This course teaches both the Python programming language itself and how to carry out descriptive and diagnostic data analysis in Python. In the Python programming part, basic topics including data types, containers and control flow will first be introduced. As advanced topics in Python programming, lambda expressions, functions, modules and regular expressions will also be explained and elaborated in great details. In the second part, this course will teach functions in the three important libraries numpy, pandas and matplotlib. With these three libraries, students are then ready to perform descriptive and diagnostic data analysis with data visualization on sample datasets provided by the course instructors. Upon the completion of the course, students should be able to carry out data analysis with Python and related libraries at a high proficient level.</p>\n",

Such processes are easily found in various industries such as manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and many more. It is challenging to model these processes mathematically using typical data models due to the complexity of the systems and the uncertain nature of the environment. Simulation becomes the feasible tool to model and study the design and operations of these real-world processes by examining its alternatives before, during and after process implementation or execution. Process simulation, when coupled with software which provides 3D models can help decision-makers to visualize and arrive at evidence-based conclusions to improve their business operations. </p>\n",

This course is designed for students who wish to master Python as a programming language and build data analysis solutions with Python along with several widely used libraries. This course teaches both the Python programming language itself and how to carry out descriptive and diagnostic data analysis in Python. In the Python programming part, basic topics including data types, containers and control flow will first be introduced. As advanced topics in Python programming, lambda expressions, functions, modules and regular expressions will also be explained and elaborated in great details. In the second part, this course will teach functions in the three important libraries numpy, pandas and matplotlib. With these three libraries, students are then ready to perform descriptive and diagnostic data analysis with data visualization on sample datasets provided by the course instructors. Upon the completion of the course, students should be able to carry out data analysis with Python and related libraries at a high proficient level.\n",

      "                                            Many real-world business processes are highly complex, dynamic (evolving over time) and uncertain (subject to random events and behaviour). Such processes are easily found in various industries such as manufacturing, retail, healthcare, and many more. It is challenging to model these processes mathematically using typical data models due to the complexity of the systems and the uncertain nature of the environment. Simulation becomes the feasible tool to model and study the design and operations of these real-world processes by examining its alternatives before, during and after process implementation or execution. Process simulation, when coupled with software which provides 3D models can help decision-makers to visualize and arrive at evidence-based conclusions to improve their business operations. \n",
      "                                            This course covers the Predictive and Prescriptive analytics by modeling and simulating the behaviour of real-world processes using discrete-event simulation. You will be introduced to the application and theoretical background of simulation modeling. Topics covered include abstracting real-world process as a digital replica, statistical input modelling, verification and validation, design of experiments, statistical analysis of output data, simulation optimisation and digital twin. A simulation software will be used for modeling the complex business processes and designing data-driven solutions to achieve desired business outcomes. \n",
